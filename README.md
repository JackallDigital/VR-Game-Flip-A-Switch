# VR-Game-Flip-A-Switch

This game and its name was inspired by the Whack-A-Mole game. The premise is simple, if a switch turns off, flip it back on.
Where is the game being used? It is used as promotion at various venues by the company ETI which makes fuses, electrical switches and other electrical products.

The game was made in Unity as it has easy integration with Meta Quest devices, and it's true as this was my first VR project.

I have added all sorts of things to this simple game:
- instructions
- 2 minute duration,
- multiple visuals,
- different sound efefcts,
- various animations,
- custom score display using an analog meter,
- an analog timer,
- the game ends when it thunders.

After initial feedback:
- highlighted start button,
- 1 minute duration,
- digital timer,
- TOP 10 score list,
- funny random generated names, 
- The scores can also be reset(deleted) ingame.


There is probably a lot more that I have added but forgotten since then. If you ask for code I can not share it, but I can share this fullscreen recorded gameplay inside Unity, as I don't have access to a VR headset.
